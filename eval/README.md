# Evaluation
To run the evaluation, run script run.sh. 
```bash
bash run.sh
```
This script run five iterations of the unroll and invariant versions of the symbolic interpreter **Vivienne**.

Each directory contains compiled versions of the specific implementations from different libraries, like *Libsodium*, *BearSSL*, HACL\*, etc. For each implementation the security policy is defined in the main script or in additional scripts.
